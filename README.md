# libft

libft is a project from 42 school that aims to create your own library of functions in C. The purpose of the library is to provide an implementation of standard C library functions that can be used in future projects instead of the actual library functions.

## Installation

To use the libft library in your project, you first need to clone the GitHub repository and compile the libft.a file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd libft
    ```

3. Compile the library `make`:

    make
    ```

This will compile the library and generate a `libft.a` file that can be used in your project.

## Usage
